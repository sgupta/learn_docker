   Build A simple image with shellscript 
   Build a hello word docker images from "busybee" linux contained using a shell script.This image will run and print "Hello World"
   Create Dokerfile and a shell script as below in same directory 
 ```               
        #Dockerfile
        FROM busybox
        COPY /print_hello.sh /
        RUN sh /print_hello.sh
        
        #Shell script
        #!/bin/sh
        echo "Hello World!"

# Docker file options
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The build’s context is the set of files at a specified location PATH or URL. The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.

A context is processed recursively. So, a PATH includes any subdirectories and the URL includes the repository and its submodules. This example shows a build command that uses the current directory as context:
```
$ docker build .

#Traditionally, the Dockerfile is called Dockerfile and located in the root of the context. You use the -f flag with docker build to point to a Dockerfile anywhere in your file system.

$ docker build -f /path/to/a/Dockerfile .

#You can specify a repository and tag at which to save the new image if the build succeeds:

$ docker build -t sgupta/myapp .

```
OPTION | FUNCTION | EXTRAS
------------ | -------------|-----------
FROM | Download base image for build | "FROM centos7:latest"
ENV | Environment varibales | "ENV HOME=/home/sgupta"
WORKDIR |Set working directory inside image being prossed| "WORKDIR ${HOME}/project1"
RUN | Execute commands during build | `RUN cd /root` or `RUN ["ls", "-l", "/root"]`
COPY | Copy files or directoreis from source(local space) to destination(inside image)| `COPY python/*.py .`
ADD | Same as copy but can **use url as source and extract a tar file in destination**|`ADD https://getenvoy.io/cli project1/`

## Dockerfile format
Docker runs instructions in a Dockerfile in order.
### FROM
A Dockerfile must begin with a `FROM` instruction. FROM instructions support variables that are declared by any ARG instructions that occur before the first FROM.Optionally a name can be given to a new build stage by adding AS name to the FROM instruction. The name can be used in subsequent FROM and COPY --from=<name|index> instructions to refer to the image built in this stage.
With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image.


```FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>] ```

```

### Environment variable
Environment variables (declared with the ENV statement) can also be used in certain instructions as variables to be interpreted by the Dockerfile. 
Environment variables are notated in the Dockerfile either with $variable_name or ${variable_name}. 
The ${variable_name} syntax also supports a few of the standard bash modifiers as specified below:

${variable:-word} indicates that if variable is set then the result will be that value. If variable is not set then word will be the result.
${variable:+word} indicates that if variable is set then word will be the result, otherwise the result is the empty string.
In all cases, word can be any string, including additional environment variables.

Escaping is possible by adding a \ before the variable: \$foo or \${foo}, for example, will translate to $foo and ${foo} literals respectively.

Environment variables are supported by the following list of instructions in the Dockerfile:

ADD
COPY
ENV
EXPOSE
FROM
LABEL
STOPSIGNAL
USER
VOLUME
WORKDIR
ONBUILD (when combined with one of the supported instructions above)
Example -
```
FROM busybox
ENV HOME="/home/sgupta"
WORKDIR ${HOME}
```
### WORKDIR
The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.
The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile. If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction. For example:
EXAMPLE
```
[sgupta3@dockermgr2 example2]$ cat dockerfile
FROM busybox:glibc
#Set environmenent variable HOME
ENV  HOME=/home/sgupta
#WORKDIR will change working directory inside image to WORKDIR
WORKDIR ${HOME}
#Too bad you can not use environment variable in RUN command
RUN ["touch", "/home/sgupta/key" ]
#This will prove working directory changed to $HOME
RUN pwd
#Again change working directory which will be relative to previously set
WORKDIR project
#Prove it
RUN pwd

### RUN 
The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created from any point in an image’s history, much like source control.
RUN has 2 forms:

1. RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c

2. RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form) ##The exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to RUN commands using a base image that does not contain the specified shell executable.

[sgupta3@dockermgr2 example2]$ cat dockerfile
